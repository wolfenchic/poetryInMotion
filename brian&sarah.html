THE WEDDING OF BRIAN & SARAH DECEMBER 2017
Here we are its Christmas time,
And we’re all feeling merry,
It’s the wedding of the year today
It’s Mayo versus Kerry.

In preparation for the wedding
I was sitting in my home
So I got a pen and paper
And I wrote a little poem

The big day it is upon us
The biggest day of Brians life
After all the years of trying
Sarahs finally his wife

When Brian saw her in Kilkenny
He thought he died and went to heaven
He produced All Ireland tickets
For the final of two thousand eleven

They’ve shared some wonderful times together
Mount Brandon, New York & Rome,
But Ballina and Templenoe
Is there spiritual home.




When Kerry played Mayo in Limerick
It really was a sight
To see an engaged couple
Nearly having a full on fight

Ardnaree Sarsfields played Templenoe
You couldn’t make it up
A very sad day for Sarahs gang
As Templenoe lifted the cup 

Sarah bought some Hunter wellies
For the big trip to Blackwater
Where (Brians parents names)
Took her under their wing
And loved her like their daughter.

Chasing cows and chasing Brian
Sarah finally had her man
The girl who shares a birthday
With the legend Pat Spillane.

There’s a little rumour going round
That Brian would love to play for Cork
But he finally popped the question
On a holiday in New York


So raise your glass and have a drink
Be it wine or gin or beer
I hope you will enjoy the day
And the wedding of the year

To Sarah & Brian, a massive congrats
The beautiful bride and groom,
We wish you both a brilliant life
From everyone in the room xxx
