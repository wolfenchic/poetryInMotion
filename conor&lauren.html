Wedding Poem of Conor & Lauren,
We’re gathered here in Malta,
Not a cloud up in the sky,
For the wedding of the summer,
On the 14th of July.
What a wonderful occasion
The biggest day of Conors life
After 7 years of trying
Lauren’s finally his wife.
The man with the massive afro
And a bulging pair of thighs
It was love at first sight for Lauren
When she saw those big green eyes
Look at Dani Alves
Beaming there with pride
Beside the lovely Lauren,
His gorgeous, stunning bride.
Conor the Blackrock lads all love you,
Your one of our best pals,
But Belvo was always the dream for you
With Damo, Podge & O Malls


Gathered here with our loved ones
And the friends that we all miss
One person not here on this special day
Is Conors mother Chris
Christine was one of our favourite people
She was always full of love
I’m sure she’s having a glass of champers
And looking down from above.
For all the single women here,
Feeling slightly giddy?
I’m afraid that I’m a married man
But have you met my friend Pete Diddy?
Lauren you’re a lucky woman,
Marrying one life’s greatest men
Next we’re off to London
For the wedding of Alex & Gem.
This poem is nearly over,
We’re all dying for a bottle of ken,
Enjoy the celebrations,
Let us go in peace,
Amen
