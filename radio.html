                            Watching the US Open,
                            <br>
                            Chilling out at home,
                            <br>
                            I got a pen and paper,
                            <br>
                            And I wrote a little poem.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You ask someone to marry you, 
                            <br>
                            And pray to God they don’t say no, 
                            <br>
                            Here’s a few lines for Today FM, 
                            <br>
                            And the Ian Dempsey Show.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The celebration of your wedding, 
                            <br>
                            The best day of your life, 
                            <br>
                            Himself becomes the hubby,
                            <br>
                            And your one becomes the wife.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A few drinks at the hotel, 
                            <br>
                            And chats about the hen, 
                            <br>
                            Lads checking out the young ones
                            <br>
                            Women checking out the men.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            OMG, AMAZEBALLS,
                          <br>
                          Everyone looks so fine,
                          <br>
                          But that’s after 11 pints,
                          <br>
                          And a bucket load of wine.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Laughing, joking messing,
                          <br>
                          Dancing around the room,
                          <br>
                          Compliments for the bridesmaids
                          <br>
                          Sambucas for the groom.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Boring speeches by the parents
                          <br>
